# LedgerFusion: Streamlining Distributed Ledger Interactions

LedgerFusion is a Go-based framework designed to simplify and standardize interactions with multiple distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). It abstracts away the complexities of individual ledger implementations, offering a unified interface for developers to build applications without needing to deeply understand the intricacies of each specific blockchain or distributed ledger. This allows for faster development cycles, increased code reusability, and easier integration of DLTs into existing systems.

The core purpose of LedgerFusion is to provide a consistent abstraction layer for commonly used DLT operations, such as creating transactions, querying ledger state, and managing identities. By decoupling application logic from the underlying ledger, LedgerFusion enables developers to switch between different DLT platforms with minimal code changes. This offers valuable flexibility, particularly in scenarios where a project might need to migrate to a different ledger, integrate with multiple ledgers simultaneously, or test compatibility across various platforms. The framework supports a plugin architecture allowing for extensibility to accommodate new and emerging DLT technologies as they arise.

LedgerFusion aims to address the challenges of DLT fragmentation by offering a centralized point of access. This promotes interoperability and reduces the learning curve associated with working with various DLTs. Instead of needing to learn the specific APIs and data structures of, for example, Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, and Corda, developers can leverage the unified LedgerFusion API to perform common operations across all supported ledgers. The framework also includes features for managing cryptographic keys and identities, ensuring secure and consistent handling of sensitive information across different DLT environments.

## Key Features

*   **Unified API:** Provides a consistent Go interface for interacting with various DLTs. This abstraction simplifies development and reduces the code required to perform common ledger operations. For example, you can use a single function call to submit a transaction, regardless of the underlying ledger technology. `ledgerfusion.SubmitTransaction(ledgerName, transactionData)`

*   **Plugin-Based Architecture:** Supports a modular design allowing for easy integration of new DLT implementations. Developers can create plugins for specific ledgers, extending the framework's functionality without modifying the core codebase. This ensures that LedgerFusion remains adaptable to emerging DLT technologies. Plugins are loaded dynamically at runtime.

*   **Identity Management:** Offers a secure and consistent way to manage cryptographic keys and identities across different DLTs. This feature simplifies the process of creating and managing user accounts and permissions on the various supported ledgers. Supports key rotation and secure storage using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

*   **Transaction Abstraction:** Provides a high-level abstraction for creating and submitting transactions. Developers can define transaction structures in a ledger-agnostic way, and LedgerFusion will handle the specific formatting and signing requirements of each underlying ledger.

*   **Query Engine:** Includes a powerful query engine for retrieving data from the ledger. This engine supports a variety of query types, including point lookups, range queries, and complex filtering operations. The query language is based on a simplified version of SQL.

*   **Event Listener:** Allows applications to subscribe to events emitted by the ledger. This feature enables real-time monitoring of ledger activity and allows applications to react to changes in the ledger state. Events are delivered via a WebSocket interface.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The core language used for building LedgerFusion. Go provides excellent performance, concurrency, and cross-platform compatibility.
*   **gRPC:** Used for inter-process communication between the core LedgerFusion framework and the DLT-specific plugins. This allows for modularity and scalability.
*   **Protocol Buffers:** Used for defining the data structures and service interfaces for gRPC. Protocol Buffers provide efficient serialization and deserialization of data.
*   **cobra:** Utilized for building the command-line interface (CLI) for LedgerFusion. Cobra simplifies the creation of powerful and user-friendly command-line tools.
*   **viper:** Used for configuration management. Viper supports various configuration file formats (e.g., YAML, JSON) and provides a flexible way to manage application settings.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or later) and configured correctly. Verify this by running `go version`. You also need to have `git` installed to clone the repository.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the LedgerFusion repository from GitHub:
    `git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/LedgerFusion`

3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    `cd LedgerFusion`

4.  **Install Dependencies:** Use the `go mod` command to download and install the required dependencies:
    `go mod tidy`

5.  **Build the Project:** Compile the LedgerFusion executable:
    `go build -o ledgerfusion`

6.  **Install the Executable (Optional):** To make the `ledgerfusion` executable available system-wide, you can install it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory:
    `go install`

## Configuration

LedgerFusion uses environment variables for configuration. The following environment variables are supported:

*   `LEDGERFUSION_PORT`: The port on which the LedgerFusion server will listen (default: 50051).
*   `LEDGERFUSION_PLUGIN_DIR`: The directory where DLT-specific plugins are located (default: ./plugins).
*   `LEDGERFUSION_LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., debug, info, warn, error) (default: info).
*   `LEDGERFUSION_DATABASE_URL`: The URL for the database used to store configuration data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). This is optional, and if not set, in-memory storage is used.

You can set these environment variables in your shell or create a `.env` file in the project directory. For example:

`export LEDGERFUSION_PORT=60000`
`export LEDGERFUSION_PLUGIN_DIR=/opt/ledgerfusion/plugins`

## Usage

After installing and configuring LedgerFusion, you can start the server using the `ledgerfusion` command:

`./ledgerfusion server`

This will start the LedgerFusion server, listening on the specified port.

To interact with the LedgerFusion server, you can use the command-line interface (CLI). The CLI provides commands for managing ledgers, deploying contracts, submitting transactions, and querying ledger state.

For example, to list the available ledgers:

`./ledgerfusion ledger list`

To deploy a contract to a specific ledger:

`./ledgerfusion contract deploy --ledger=myledger --contract=mycontract.wasm`

To submit a transaction:

`./ledgerfusion transaction submit --ledger=myledger --function=transfer --args="alice,bob,100"`

The specific commands and options available in the CLI will depend on the plugins that are installed and configured. Detailed API documentation (including gRPC service definitions) is available in the `docs/api` directory. This documentation outlines how to interact with the LedgerFusion service programmatically using Go or other gRPC-compatible languages.
